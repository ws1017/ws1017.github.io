# 陪伴

I'm here for you.

I won't judge.

Tell me how you are feeling.

I'm feeling depress.

Take your time. (慢慢来)

I care about you.

You're not alone

I just wish that you're here with me.

It's just you and me.

Do you want some space.

Do you want to be punched in the face?

Don't be too hard on yourself.

My desk is so messy

It's so hard being a warm considerate guy all the time.
