##### Some StarBucks vocabulary (2019/10/17)

Most people get a good of coffee in the morning to get them ready for brand  new day. When you think of good coffee, Starbucks is a brand that's probably gonna cross your mind. So, today, I will be sharing with you guys some of the most basic terms that you'll need to know if you wanna order a cup of coffee at Starbucks!

First thing first, classic cup sizes: tall, grande, venti. If you'd like an even smaller cup of coffee than a tall, you can ask for "short", this is only available for hot drinks. If you'd like an evan bigger cup of beverage than a venti, you can ask for "trenta", this is only available for cold drink and you can only get them in the States. Grande is Italian for large, venti means "twenty", trenta means "thirty", there is a variety of different coffee types that you can get. 

Today I'll be showcasing some of the more popular ones, "卡布奇诺" in English is Cappuccino, Next, "拿铁" in English is Latte. Then we have, "美式" in English is Americano. And then "摩卡" in English is Mocha. Next up, "浓缩咖啡" in English is Espresson. Next, "焦糖玛奇朵" in English is Caramel Macchiato. Last, and my personal favorite, "星冰乐" in English is Frappuccino. Frappuccino is a new word made by combining frappe, a kind of milkshake with ice cream and cappuccino. 

Finally, let's take a look at the different function boxes on a Starbucks cup. "低咖啡因咖啡" in English is decaf, short for decaffeinated. "浓缩咖啡计算单位" in English is shots. For espresso shots, you can ask for a single shot, a double shot, a trip shot, or even a quad shot. "糖浆" in English is syrup. There is a ton of different flavored syrups that you can choose from Starbucks, caramel, hazelnut, vanilla and more. "牛奶" in English is milk, you can choose whether you want whole milk, non-fat milk, or soy milk. "客制化" in English is custom. For example, you can tell them that you want "no foam", or "no whipped cream". "饮料名称" in English is drink, For example, I got a caramel Macchiato the other day, so it says CM here,
